/**
 * Typed data adapter interface for the Vaults feature.
 *
 * The Phase 2 options vault contract is scaffolded under `contracts/vault`
 * (crate `zenith-options-vault`), but it is not yet deployed and the backend
 * API is not yet available. This module is unrelated to the margin-collateral
 * vault in `./vault.ts`. When NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULTS=mock (or the env var is absent), the mock
 * implementation below is used. Swap in the real implementation by
 * setting NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULTS=live, which calls the backend vault registry
 * (Zenith-options/backend) through the REST contract below.
 *
 * Backend contract (for when the real API lands):
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults?cursor=<opaque>&limit=<n>
 *   → { items: VaultSummary[]; nextCursor: string | null; cache: CacheMeta }
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults/{id}
 *   → VaultDetail
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults/{id}/epochs?cursor=<opaque>&limit=<n>
 *   → { items: EpochRecord[]; nextCursor: string | null; cache: CacheMeta }
 *
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/{id}/deposit   { amount: number; disclosure_version: string }  → { tx_id: string }
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/{id}/withdraw  { shares: number }  → { tx_id: string; queued: boolean; request_id: string }
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/{id}/withdrawals/{request_id}/cancel → { returned_shares: number }
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults/positions
 *   → VaultPositionWire[]  (one row per vault the wallet holds; `error` set when that vault failed)
 *
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/disclosures/acknowledge
 *     { disclosure_version, text_hash, jurisdiction_attested }  → DisclosureAcknowledgement
 *   GET  /api/v1/vaults/disclosures/me  → DisclosureAcknowledgement[]
 *
 * Deposits are rejected server-side (403 with a PolicyReasonCode) unless the
 * wallet holds an acknowledgement for the current disclosure version. The
 * client check in the UI is advisory only.
 *
 * Withdrawal queue semantics (mock implements these; the live contract must match):
 *
 *   - Request: shares are escrowed on request. Escrowed shares stay in totalShares
 *     (so NAV per share is unaffected by the queue) but cannot be requested again.
 *   - Ordering: requests are served by (request epoch, then seq). Requests from an
 *     earlier epoch are always served first. `seq` is a monotonic tie-break assigned
 *     at request time. Unfilled requests keep their epoch, seq and requestedAt.
 *   - Fill: each epoch cohort is valued at the processing NAV. If the remaining
 *     liquidity covers the cohort, every request fills 100%. If it does not, every
 *     request in that cohort fills the same pro-rata fraction, and later cohorts get
 *     nothing this pass. `fillFraction` is recorded per request.
 *   - Processing: a keeper calls `processWithdrawalQueue` at an epoch boundary with the
 *     NAV per share and liquidity at that point. At most MAX_COHORTS_PER_PASS cohorts
 *     are examined per call. Filled shares leave totalShares and the user's shares.
 *   - Settlement NAV: a processed request pays out at the NAV passed to the keeper,
 *     not the NAV at request time.
 *   - Cancellation: only requests still in the queue can be cancelled. The escrow that
 *     remains is returned in full. Any part already filled stays paid out.
 *   - Pause: not modeled in the mock. The intended rule is that a paused vault blocks new
 *     requests but still processes queued ones.
 *
 * Pagination & caching (issue #223):
 *   - List and epoch-history reads are cursor-paginated (never offset). The
 *     cursor is an opaque token over a stable sort key (vault id / epoch
 *     number), so inserting a new epoch mid-pagination neither skips nor
 *     duplicates rows. Page size is capped at VAULT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE.
 *   - Responses carry `cache` freshness metadata so the UI can show whether
 *     NAV values are live or served from cache.
 *
 * Security baseline (issue #220):
 *   - Writes require the `vault:deposit` / `vault:withdraw` scope; the BFF
 *     rejects with 403 when the session token lacks it.
 *   - Writes carry an `Idempotency-Key` header so a legitimately retried
 *     deposit is not double-submitted.
 *   - Amounts/shares are validated client-side (finite, positive, bounded
 *     precision) before they reach the contract layer.
 *   - Rate limits are per-wallet (primary) and per-IP (secondary); a 429
 *     response includes a `retryAfter` hint in seconds.
 *
 * Loss recognition & insolvency (issue #225):
 *   - A realized loss larger than premium + reserves is allocated by a
 *     deterministic waterfall: fee reserves → first-loss buffer → pro-rata
 *     share write-down. Any residual beyond total NAV is recorded as explicit
 *     protocol bad debt (never an underflow).
 *   - NAV per share is clamped at zero and never reported negative.
 *   - While an unresolved loss event exists the vault is `impaired` and
 *     deposits are disabled.
 *
 * NAV / share-price source of truth (issue #290):
 *
 *   Share issuance is priced from the vault's internal book value
 *   (`bookValue`), NOT from the raw token balance held at the vault
 *   contract address. Direct token transfers to the contract are
 *   classified as `ignored` — they do not move NAV and cannot be used
 *   to inflate the share price. This classification is identical across
 *   the contract, the backend indexer/registry, and this adapter.
 *
 *   Inflation / donation-attack mitigations are per-vault config
 *   (`inflationDefense`) and are changeable only through the timelocked
 *   operator path. The adapter surfaces them so the UI can enforce the
 *   same `minSharesOut` bound the contract enforces on deposit.
 *
 * Shadow mode (issue #292):
 *
 *   A strategy may run in `shadow` mode — the identical strategy module
 *   and keeper path execute against live oracle/engine data, but no
 *   option orders are submitted and no depositor collateral is
 *   committed. Shadow state lives in its own namespace (`shadow` on the
 *   detail payload) with its own hypothetical NAV-per-share series and
 *   epoch record stream. It is NEVER merged into `bookValue`,
 *   `sharePrice`, `tvl`, or `historicalEpochs`, and shadow runs are
 *   labeled `mode: "shadow"` everywhere they surface so paper results
 *   cannot be mistaken for realized performance.
 *
 * Depositor privacy (issue #231):
 *
 *   GET  /api/v1/vaults/privacy/export?wallet={address}
 *   → DepositorDataExport
 *
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/privacy/deletion-request  { wallet: string; reason?: string }
 *   → DeletionRequestReceipt
 *
 *   GET  /api/v1/vaults/privacy/deletion-request/{id}
 *   → DeletionRequestReceipt
 *
 * Public read-only partner API (issue #233):
 *
 *   GET /api/public/v1/vaults?limit={n}&cursor={c}
 *   → PublicVaultListResponse
 *
 *   GET /api/public/v1/vaults/{id}
 *   → PublicVaultDetail
 *
 *   GET /api/public/v1/vaults/{id}/epochs?limit={n}&cursor={c}
 *   → PublicEpochHistoryResponse
 *
 * The public surface is a projection over the same vault registry/epoch
 * ledger, served from a cache independent of the authenticated read path.
 * It never exposes per-depositor data (see `toPublicVaultSummary`).
 *
 * See docs/privacy/vault-data-inventory.md for the data inventory, retention
 * windows, and the deletion/export workflow this module mirrors.
