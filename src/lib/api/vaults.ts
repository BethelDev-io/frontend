/**
 * Typed data adapter interface for the Vaults feature.
 *
 * The vault smart contracts and backend API are not yet available.
 * When NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULTS=mock (or the env var is absent), the mock
 * implementation below is used. Swap in the real implementation by
 * setting NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULTS=live and implementing `fetchVaultsLive`.
 *
 * Backend contract (for when the real API lands):
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults
 *   → VaultSummary[]
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/vaults/{id}
 *   → VaultDetail
 *
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/{id}/deposit   { amount: number }  → { tx_id: string }
 *   POST /api/v1/vaults/{id}/withdraw  { shares: number }  → { tx_id: string; queued: boolean }
 *
 * NAV / share-price source of truth (issue #290):
 *
 *   Share issuance is priced from the vault's internal book value
 *   (`bookValue`), NOT from the raw token balance held at the vault
 *   contract address. Direct token transfers to the contract are
 *   classified as `ignored` — they do not move NAV and cannot be used
 *   to inflate the share price. This classification is identical across
 *   the contract, the backend indexer/registry, and this adapter.
 *
 *   Inflation / donation-attack mitigations are per-vault config
 *   (`inflationDefense`) and are changeable only through the timelocked
 *   operator path. The adapter surfaces them so the UI can enforce the
 *   same `minSharesOut` bound the contract enforces on deposit.
